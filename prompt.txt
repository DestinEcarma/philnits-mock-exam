Prompt:

Clear any history related to JSON content.

Please generate an array of JSON files in the following format:

```typescript
export interface QuizQuestion {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: number;
  solution?: string; // Optional field for markdown solution
}
```

Instructions:

1. **Do not modify any text** from the original content.
2. If the question contains an image, retain it and ensure proper Markdown formatting: `![Alt](path)`.
   - The image path should begin with `Files/` followed by the pathname. For example, convert `![[Pasted image 20241017134330.png]]` into `![Image](Files/Pasted%20image%2020241017134330.png)`.
3. The same applies to images in the **solution** field: convert paths accordingly and retain the Markdown format.
4. Only include the options in the `options` field. Do not include the choices directly in the question text.
5. Remove any "a)", "b)", "c)", etc., from the options. Only include the words or values.
6. Ensure that **LaTeX is fixed for compatibility** with MDEditor. This includes handling any necessary escapes or formatting changes.
7. **Always use at least two `
`** to create new lines instead of a single `
`. For example: `

(1)...`. Do not use a single `
` unless explicitly required.
8. **Keep all original content intact**, including solutions, explanations, and any extra details. Do not add new information or modify existing content.
