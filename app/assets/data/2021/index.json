        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "solution": "In a **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)** network, such as Ethernet, the following transmission operation is used:\n\n1. **Carrier Sense**: Each node listens to the communication medium to check if it is idle (i.e., no other device is transmitting).\n\n2. **Multiple Access**: All nodes have equal access to the medium and can transmit whenever they sense that the medium is free.\n\n3. **Collision Detection**: If two nodes transmit simultaneously, a **collision** occurs. Each node detects this collision.\n\n4. **Random Backoff**: After detecting a collision, each node waits for a random backoff time (calculated using a specific algorithm) before attempting to retransmit. This reduces the likelihood of another collision happening immediately.\n\nThis process ensures that multiple devices can share the same communication medium while minimizing the impact of collisions.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**a) All nodes are connected in a ring topology, where a special frame is circulated around to control transmission rights. Only the node that has the special frame can transmit data.**:\n\n- This describes the **token ring** network, where a special frame called a **token** circulates around the network, and only the node that possesses the token can transmit data. This is not how CSMA/CD operates.\n\n**b) Each node is logically ordered, a transmission right is passed along in order, and only the node that has received the right can transmit data.**:\n\n- This describes **token passing**, used in certain network topologies, but it is not related to CSMA/CD, which does not involve a transmission right being passed around in a logical order.\n\n**d) Only the node that has a time slot assigned can transmit data.**:\n\n- This describes **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**, where each node is assigned specific time slots for transmission. In contrast, CSMA/CD does not use predefined time slots; it is based on listening to the medium and avoiding collisions."

        "solution": "**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is a **symmetric encryption method**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It is widely used for encrypting data, including data stored in databases, due to its efficiency and security. AES is considered very strong and is commonly used in securing sensitive information.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**b) PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**:\n\n- **PKI** is not an encryption method itself, but a framework that uses **asymmetric encryption** (e.g., RSA) to manage public and private keys. Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption, which is different from what the question is asking.\n\n**c) RSA**:\n\n- **RSA** is an **asymmetric encryption method**, meaning it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is not suitable for encrypting large amounts of data like in databases, and it does not use the same key for both encryption and decryption.\n\n**d) SHA-256**:\n\n- **SHA-256** is a **hashing algorithm**, not an encryption method.

Port 25 is primarily used for sending email messages from a client to a server or between servers. It facilitates the transfer of emails from one mail server to another, playing a critical role in email communication\n\n**OP25B (Outbound Port 25 Blocking)** is a technique invented and used mainly by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Japan to block or restrict outbound traffic on **port 25**, the port traditionally used for **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** communication. Port 25 is often exploited by spammers to send large volumes of unsolicited emails (spam) directly to mail servers. By blocking or filtering traffic on this port, ISPs can reduce the risk of spam originating from infected or compromised devices within their network, helping to prevent mass-scale spam or junk email delivery.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**b) Blocking emails that are sent to more than 25 recipients at once due to organizational policy**:\n\n- This describes a specific policy that limits the number of recipients for an email, but it is unrelated to **OP25B**, which deals with blocking port 25, not limiting the number of recipients.\n\n**c) Blocking Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) communication except those sent to port 25**:\n\n- This is incorrect because **OP25B** is specifically about **blocking or restricting port 25**, not allowing only port 25.

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "solution": "This option accurately describes the relationship in object-oriented programming (OOP). A class serves as a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors (methods) of objects. An instance, also known as an object, is created using this blueprint, encapsulating the data and functionality defined by the class. Each instance can have its own unique state while adhering to the structure and rules established by the class.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**a) An instance defines the specifications of a class.**\n\n- This statement is incorrect because it reverses the relationship. A class defines the specifications and behavior that instances will follow, not the other way around.\n\n**c) Multiple classes correspond to a single instance.**\n\n- This is misleading. An instance is typically associated with one specific class. While an instance can inherit characteristics from multiple classes in some programming paradigms (like multiple inheritance), it is still tied to a specific class definition.\n\n**d) Only one (1) instance exists for a single class.**\n\n- This statement is also false. A class can have multiple instances created from it. Each instance represents a unique object that can have different values for its properties while following the same class structure."

        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "solution": "According to [kharagpurcollege.ac.in/studyMaterial/173830Lecture-9-Coupling-cohesion, 2nd semester by Alok Haldar.pdf], The coupling is **the degree of interdependence between software modules**. Two modules that are tightly coupled are strongly dependent on each other. Two modules that are loosely coupled are not dependent on each other.\n\n**c) To pass only required data items as arguments between two (2) modules.**\n\n- This option represents the weakest coupling between modules. By passing only the necessary data items, modules remain independent and less affected by changes in each other. This promotes better maintainability, as changes in one module are less likely to impact others, adhering to the principles of modularity.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**a) To implement as many functions as possible with a single module.**\n\n- This approach typically leads to high coupling because it combines multiple responsibilities within a single module, making it difficult to modify or test independently.\n\n**b) To pass arguments that control another module's logic when the module is called.**\n\n- This creates tighter coupling between the modules, as one module is directly influencing the behavior of another. Changes in the controlling module could necessitate changes in the controlled module.\n\n**d) To use a global area to share data items with other modules.**\n\n- Using global variables for sharing data increases coupling significantly, as multiple modules may depend on the state of these shared variables. This can lead to issues with maintainability and can make it difficult to track data flow within the system."

Slack time specifically refers to how much an activity can be delayed without impacting other activities or the project.\n\n**b) It is the amount of time for which a non-critical path activity can be deferred without delaying the project.**\n\n- While this is close, it limits slack time to non-critical path activities.

It is a critical component of any technology vendor contract.\n\nIn this question it is given in the SLA that the service period is 1 month and that the service time period for this whole month is from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM, which amounts to 14 hours a day. If the availability of said service should be 99.5%, then the maximum downtime can be calculated using the following formula\n\ndowntime = total hours - minimum required available hours\n\ndowntime = $(30 \\times 14) - (0.995)(30 \\times 14)$ = 2.1\n\ndowntime = $420 - 417.9$ = 2.1\n\nin this equation, 30 is the number of business days, 14 is the amount of hours per day that the service must be available, and 0.995 is the decimal equivalent of the service availability percentage. The total hours that the service is up in 30 business days is 420, and the required number of hours that the service must be available is 417.9.

This is to hope for a choice that immediately gives a terminating number on the first try.\n\n**Condition:** Achieve a result where the fractional part is `0`\n#### a) $0.3\\cdot 8 = 2.4$\n#### b) $0.4*8 = 3.2$\n#### c) $0.5*8 = 4.0$ !!\n#### d) $0.8*8 = 6.4$\n\nTherefore, we arrive at our answer, `c)`\n\n## In-Depth Approach\n### Step 1: Multiply fractional part by base number\nThis is according to the general conversion process of decimal fractions to any base number\n$$\\text{formula} = \\text{fractional part} \\cdot \\text{base number}$$\n\nSince we are looking for the `octal fraction`, our `base is 8`, so for letter **a)**\n$0.3 \\cdot 8 = 2.4$\n\n### Step 2: Separate whole number and fractional number from Step 1\nReferring to Step 1:\n$2.4 \\rightarrow 0.4$ , $2$\n\nBreak down uses:\n- **whole number** - for getting the final octal fraction\n- **fractional number** - for continued multiplication\n\n### Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until fractional number is 0\nIdeally, we create a table to keep track of the process.\n\n|             |                  |  Result   | Fractional |  Whole  |\n| :---------: | :--------------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-----: |\n|   **(1)**   |   $0.3\\cdot 8$   |   $2.4$   |   $0.4$    |   $2$   |\n| ==**(2)**== | ==$0.4\\cdot 8$== | ==$3.2$== | ==$0.2$==  | ==$3$== |\n|   **(3)**   |   $0.2\\cdot 8$   |   $0.8$   |   $0.8$    |   $0$   |\n|   **(4)**   |  $0.8 \\cdot 8$   |   $6.4$   |   $0.4$    |   $6$   |\n| ==**(5)**== | ==$0.4\\cdot 8$== | ==$3.2$== | ==$0.2$==  | ==$3$== |\n|     ...     |                  |           |            |         |\n\n**NOTE**: in this case, since we are already looping back, letter **a)** is non-terminating hence, we move on to the next choice.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: to determine a non-terminating fraction, find a step in the conversion table where a step is already similar to a previous step like in this case: `step (2)` and `step (5)`\n\n### Step 4: Repeat process to other choices until finite number\n**HOWEVER**, we can take a shortcut:\n\tif number is part of the previous table/s, it is immediately non-terminating\n#### b) 0.4\n- part of a), non-terminating\n#### d) 0.8\n- part of a), non-terminating\n\nTherefore, leaving us with\n#### c) 0.5\n\nwhich is the answer"

        "solution": "### Step 1: Get the given\n- Line speed: **8 Mbit/s** (which is **8 × 10^6** bits/s)\n- Transmission efficiency: **60%** (0.6)\n- Message size (upstream): **1 MB** = **8 × 10^6** bits\n- Message size (downstream): **2 MB** = **16 × 10^6** bits\n- Processing time at client side: **0.4 s**\n- Processing time at server side: **0.4 s**\n\n### Step 2: Get effective speed\nEffective Speed = 8 × 10^6 bits/s × 0.6 = **4.8 × 10^6 bits/s**\n\n### Step 3: Get transmission time\nUpstream Time = 8 × 10^6 / 4.8 × 10^6 ≈ **1.67 s**\n\nDownstream Time = 16 × 10^6 / 4.8 × 10^6 ≈ **3.33 s**\n\n### Step 4: Apply formula for response time\nResponse time = Upstream Time + Server PT + Downstream Time + Client PT\n≈ 1.67s + 0.4s + 3.33s + 0.4s\n≈ **5.8s**\n\n### Hence, the answer is **d)**"
