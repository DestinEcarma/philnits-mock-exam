        "solution": "Hashing uses a hash function to convert a key into an index in a hash table. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash code, which is then used to determine the location where the corresponding value will be stored. Therefore the closest answer is **a**.\n\n**b)** While hashing aims to minimize the number of collisions (when two different keys hash to the same index), it cannot entirely avoid them due to the limited number of available storage locations compared to the potentially infinite number of keys. Instead, hash tables implement strategies (such as chaining or open addressing) to handle collisions when they occur.\n\n**c)** Hashing and binary trees are different data structures used for searching and storing data. Binary trees, particularly binary search trees (BST), organize data in a hierarchical manner and allow for ordered retrieval. Hashing, on the other hand, relies on hash tables and does not use tree structures to store data.\n\n**d)** The average-case time complexity for searching in a well-designed hash table is **constant time**, denoted as $O(1)$, rather than being proportional to the size of the table. However, in the worst case (e.g., when many collisions occur), the time complexity can degrade to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements stored in the hash table. Nonetheless, a good hash function and collision resolution strategy typically keep search times close to constant."

It ensures the security of data transmitted over the internet by providing encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. TLS is a successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and is widely used in secure communications.

A system that is too strict may have a high FRR, causing inconvenience to legitimate users, while a system that is too lenient may have a high FAR, compromising security. Therefore, adjusting the system to find an optimal balance between FRR and FAR is crucial for ensuring both security and usability. In conclusion, option **a)** is the right choice.\n\n**b)** While keeping malware definitions updated is important for security, it does not directly relate to the performance metrics of a biometric system.\n\n**c)** Involving a third party for digital certificates is more relevant to digital signature and PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) than to biometric authentication.\n\n**d)** This option relates more to knowledge-based authentication (e.g., passwords) rather than biometrics, where the focus is on physical characteristics."

By exchanging opinions with the audited department on the draft report, the auditor can verify that the information presented is correct and that there are no misunderstandings or misinterpretations. This step helps to maintain the integrity of the audit process and ensures that the final report reflects an accurate assessment of the department's operations.\n\n### Brief Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **b)** While sharing the draft may happen, the main purpose is not to issue it prior to submission but to ensure accuracy and clarity.\n- **c)** While obtaining approval may be a goal, it is not the primary purpose of discussing the draft; auditors typically seek feedback rather than formal approval.\n- **d)** Substituting additional auditing activities is not appropriate; auditors should gather sufficient evidence before concluding, rather than relying on oral confirmation for parts of the report.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is **a) To confirm that there are no factual errors in the findings and recommendations to be described in the audit report.**"

This includes reviewing the access control rules that dictate how data can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. By viewing these rules, the auditor can assess whether they align with security policies and effectively protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.\n\n### Brief Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **a)** Creating and storing access control records is more of an operational task that falls under the responsibilities of system administrators or IT personnel rather than auditors.\n- **b)** Establishing an access control policy is a governance activity typically performed by management or security personnel, not an auditor.\n- **c)** Implementing access control procedures is also an operational task, focused on executing policies rather than auditing them.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is **d) Viewing the access control rules for data.**"
