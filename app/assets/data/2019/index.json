This configuration is applied when the process is not allowed to stop, even for a moment. If one CPU fails, the system cuts off the failed CPU and continues processing on the other CPU.\n\n### Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **a)** This describes a **hot standby system**. In this setup, a backup system is kept ready to take over the operations of an active system in the event of a failure. It emphasizes immediate availability without active processing of results by the backup system, which is common in hot standby configurations.\n\n- **b)** This describes a **fault-tolerant system** or **redundant system**. In this configuration, all components (processors, memory, etc.) are duplicated to ensure that the system continues functioning even if one component fails. The focus here is on hardware redundancy rather than system-level redundancy or active verification of outputs.\n    \n- **d)** This describes a **duplex system**. In this arrangement, one system is actively processing while another is on standby, ready to take over if the active system fails.

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "solution": "## **Explanation:**\n\nIn SQL, when you define a **FOREIGN KEY** that references another table, it creates a **referential constraint**. This constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column of a table must correspond to existing values in the primary key column of the referenced table. It maintains the **referential integrity** between two related tables.\n\n### Other Options:\n\n- **a) Assertion**: Assertions are more general constraints that ensure certain conditions are always true in a database, but they are not specifically tied to foreign key constraints.\n- **b) Check constraint**: A **CHECK constraint** ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specified condition but is not directly related to foreign key relationships.\n- **c) Key constraint**: A **key constraint** (like a primary or unique key) ensures uniqueness in a column or combination of columns but is different from a foreign key.\n\nThus, **referential constraint** is the correct term used for constraints defined using **FOREIGN KEY** and **REFERENCES**."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "solution": "## **Explanation:**\n\n**Atomicity** is one of the key properties of a transaction in database systems, often summarized as part of the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles. It ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. This means that either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied to the database, effectively rolling back any changes if an error occurs.\n\n### Other Options:\n\n- **b) Consistency**: This ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints. It does not specifically guarantee the all-or-nothing property of an update.\n- **c) Durability**: This guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its effects are permanent, even in the event of a system failure. It does not relate to whether the transaction is completed or canceled.\n- **d) Isolation**: This property ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from one another, meaning the operations of one transaction do not affect those of another. It does not guarantee that a transaction is completed or canceled.\n\nThus, **atomicity** is the characteristic that ensures the all-or-nothing nature of transactions."

    "options": [
      "AES",
      "KCipher-2",
      "RSA",
      "SHA-256"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "solution": "**RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** is a widely used public key cryptography algorithm that enables secure data transmission. It uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. RSA is commonly employed for secure communications and digital signatures.\n\n### Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **a) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.\n- **b) KCipher-2**: A symmetric encryption algorithm used for securing data, not a public key algorithm.\n- **d) SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**: A cryptographic hash function, not an encryption algorithm. It is used to generate a fixed-size hash value from input data, primarily for integrity verification.\n\nThus, RSA is the only option that is specifically designed for public key cryptography."

    "question": "Which of the following is a security attack that prevents users from accessing their accounts?",
    "options": [
      "Brute force",
      "Denial of Service",
      "Man in the middle",
      "Sniffing"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "solution": "A **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack aims to make a system or service unavailable to its intended users, effectively preventing them from accessing their accounts. This can be achieved by overwhelming the server with requests, causing legitimate users to be unable to access the service.\n\n### Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **a) Brute Force**: This attack involves attempting to guess passwords or encryption keys by trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found. It does not inherently prevent access; instead, it attempts to gain access.\n- **c) Man in the Middle**: This attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, allowing them to eavesdrop or alter the communication. It does not directly prevent users from accessing their accounts but compromises the security of their communication.\n- **d) Sniffing**: This is the act of capturing network traffic to intercept data packets, often used to gather information like passwords. It doesn't prevent access but can lead to unauthorized access if sensitive information is obtained.\n\nThus, the most appropriate option for an attack that prevents users from accessing their accounts is the **Denial of Service** attack."

      "A wireless network for industrial robots created for collaborative manufacturing in a factory to ensure quality at all levels"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "solution": "A **botnet** refers to a network of compromised computers and devices that are controlled remotely by an attacker. These devices, often referred to as 'bots' or 'zombies,' can include a variety of internet-connected devices, including personal computers, servers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Botnets are typically used to perform various malicious activities, such as launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, stealing personal information, or sending spam.\n\n### Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **b) A scalable and reliable network of self-driving vehicles communicating with each other to avoid accidents/collisions**: This describes a network of autonomous vehicles, not a botnet.\n- **c) A set of honeypots designed to detect and analyze malicious activities by hackers to secure the production systems in the future**: Honeypots are decoy systems used to attract and analyze attacks, which is different from a botnet.\n- **d) A wireless network for industrial robots created for collaborative manufacturing in a factory to ensure quality at all levels**: This describes a specific application of robotics and IoT in manufacturing, not a botnet.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate description of a botnet is **a)**."

    "question": "An attacker captures unencrypted network traffic with a tool and later analyzes it offline to learn about the information contained in those transmissions. Which of the following is this attack?",
    "options": [
      "Buffer overflow attack",
      "Phishing attack",
      "Smurf attack",
      "Sniffing attack"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "solution": "A **sniffing attack** involves capturing and analyzing network traffic as it travels across a network. Attackers use tools called packet sniffers to intercept unencrypted data packets, which may contain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. Once the attacker has captured this data, they can analyze it offline to extract useful information.\n\n### Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **a) Buffer overflow attack**: This attack exploits vulnerabilities in a program by overflowing a buffer to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.\n- **b) Phishing attack**: This is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick users into providing sensitive information, typically via email or fraudulent websites.\n- **c) Smurf attack**: This is a type of DDoS attack where an attacker sends ICMP echo requests to a network's broadcast address, causing all devices on the network to respond to a targeted victim, overwhelming it with traffic.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate classification for the described scenario is **d) Sniffing attack**."

      "Setting a password for starting or stopping the database connection program on the server"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "solution": "**Encrypting the communication between the database connection programs** is the most effective measure to prevent the leakage of commands and execution results transmitted between the application and the database. Encryption ensures that any data intercepted by an attacker while it is being transmitted is unreadable without the decryption key, thereby protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.\n\n### Overview of Other Options:\n\n- **a) Changing the port number from its initial value that the database connection programs use for communication in the database management system**: While this may reduce the likelihood of automated attacks, it does not secure the data being transmitted.\n- **c) Restricting the IP addresses of the clients that can access the database connection program on the server to only those that are required**: This enhances security by limiting access but does not protect the data in transit.\n- **d) Setting a password for starting or stopping the database connection program on the server**: This measure protects the database connection program itself but does not address the protection of data during transmission.\n\nIn summary, encryption is the key measure for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client application and the database server."
