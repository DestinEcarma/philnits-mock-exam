This paging table maps the memory address of our main memory to our secondary memory, like when code is saved to main memory & is mapped (via paging) to our main memory to execute.\n\nIf we try to access memory in our main memory that doesn't exist, it will raise a Page Fault and attempt to find the corresponding mapped page in our secondary memory.\n\n## Discussing the Answer\n\nWe might have thought of Segmentation Fault, however that is different. It's when we access memory that DOES EXIST, but we do not have access permissions.\n\n- each program is 'allocated memory' when a program runs - meaning the CPU leases it memory it can borrow and it cannot access others - otherwise it leads to a segmentation fault.\n\nIf the computer did not support paging, accessing invalid memory will cause a Fatal Error and crash the program.\n\nHowever, it does support paging, so a Page Fault is raised instead.\n\nTherefore, our answer is **b) Page fault**."

Both are used as **data storage elements**.\n\n## Why the Others Are Wrong\n\n- **a) Adder circuit**: An adder circuit performs arithmetic operations like addition but does not have stable states. It is a combinational circuit, meaning it doesn't store data but rather computes outputs based on current inputs.\n\n- **b) Capacitor**: A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores electric charge temporarily, but it does not have defined binary states in the context of a digital circuit like flip-flops do.\n\n- **d) NAND gate**: A NAND gate is a basic logic gate used in digital circuits to perform a logical operation. It's a combinational circuit that produces an output based on its current inputs, but it doesn’t have memory or stable states like a flip-flop."

In this step, the continuous analog signal is measured at discrete points in time.\n\n- **Purpose**: To capture the signal’s amplitude (value) at these regular intervals.\n\n2. **Quantization**:\n\n- After sampling, the analog values are rounded to the nearest value within a range of discrete levels. This process introduces a small\n\nerror called 'quantization noise.'\n\n- **Purpose**: To convert the sampled values into a finite set of values for easier digital representation.\n\n3. **Encoding**:\n\n- The quantized values are converted into a binary format (0s and 1s).\n\n- **Purpose**: To represent the data in digital form for storage, transmission, or processing.\n\n## The Answer\n\nd) Sampling matches the description of the question to capture analog signals at regular intervals.\n\nPCM involves three key steps: 1.

The number of ways to choose 2 members from a group of 10 (which is the number of one-on-one meetings) is given by the combination formula:\n\n$\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$\n\nWhere \\(n\\) is the number of members.\n\nFor 10 members, we can calculate the number of meetings as:\n\n$\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times (10 - 1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$\n\nSo, with 10 members, there are **45 one-on-one meetings**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of meetings with 12 members\n\nNow, if 2 more members are added, making it 12 members, we calculate the number of meetings again using the same combination formula:\n\n$\\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times (12 - 1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66$\n\nSo, with 12 members, there are **66 one-on-one meetings**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the additional meetings\n\nThe additional meetings are the difference between the number of meetings with 12 members and the number of meetings with 10 members:\n\n$\\text{Additional meetings} = 66 - 45 = 21$\n\n### Final Answer:\nThere will be **21 additional meetings** if two members are added to the team."

There is no parallel operation of the old and new systems after migration — the old system is typically shut down entirely.\n\n### Characteristics of Big Bang Migration:\n- **Immediate switch**: The transition happens all at once, meaning that when the migration is complete, users are immediately using the new system.\n- **No parallel running**: Unlike other migration strategies, such as phased migration, the old system is decommissioned once the new system goes live.\n- **High-risk but fast**: Since the entire system is swapped at once, any issues can cause major disruptions. However, it is quicker because there's no prolonged parallel operation.\n- **Lower ongoing operational costs**: Since there is no need to run both systems at the same time, the migration itself can be cheaper in terms of operations, but only if things go smoothly.\n\n### Other Choices\n- **a)** This describes a phased migration where the old and new systems operate simultaneously for a time, which is not the case with the big bang approach.\n- **b)** This might apply to a hybrid migration where two systems need to coexist temporarily.\n- **c)** This describes a phased migration or parallel running strategy, which does not apply to the big bang method."
