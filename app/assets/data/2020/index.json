If the question here were was $\\frac{7}{27}$, the shifting method cannot be used since 27 is not a power of 2.\n\t- During only ***multiplication*** and ***division*** operations. So for questions that require the addition or subtraction of decimal no. the shifting method cannot be used to convert that decimal no. to binary.\n- If **multiplication**, you have to ***left-shift***. If **division**, you have to ***right-shift***.\n- The amount of shifting to be done is dependent on $2^{n}$, $n$ here is $5$, so we have to shift 5 times here. In this case, we ***right-shift*** because the operation used was **division**.\n\n$111$ (***right-shift*** **5** times) -> $00111$\n- Since the decimal conversion wasn't a whole no. then we add $0.$ to obtain the final result.\n$00111$ -> $0.00111$\n- Therefore, the final answer is $0.00111$."

If a task is doing I/O, the CPU is allocated to the next highest-priority task that is ready for CPU execution.\n\n- **Task A (High priority)**:\n\t- Starts at $3$ ms with $2$ ms of CPU time, so it will run from **3 ms to 5 ms**.\n\t- It will then need I/O for $2$ ms (from **5 ms to 7 ms**), during which the CPU is free for another task.\n- **Task B (Medium priority)**:\n\t- While Task A is doing I/O (from **5 ms to 7 ms**), Task B can start its CPU execution since it has the next highest priority.\n\t- Task B needs $3$ ms of CPU, but since it can only execute for $2$ ms before Task A is ready to reclaim the CPU, Task B will run from **5 ms to 7 ms**.\n\t- Task B will now be interrupted to let Task A finish its CPU burst.\n- **Task A resumes**:\n\t- At **7 ms**, Task A finishes its I/O and reclaims the CPU for its final $2$ ms burst. Task A completes at **9 ms**.\n- **Task B resumes**:\n\t- After Task A finishes at $9$ ms, Task B will resume and complete its final $1$ ms of CPU time (since it only ran for 2 ms earlier).\n\t- Task B completes at **10 ms**.\n- **Task C (Low priority)**:\n\t- Task C can only start its execution once both higher-priority tasks are either in I/O or completed.\n\t- Task C will start at **7 ms**, as Task A is doing I/O and Task B is running.\n\t- Task C performs $2$ ms of CPU from **7 ms to 9 ms**, and then will need I/O. However, Task A resumes and finishes before Task C gets a chance to proceed further.\n\n### Step 4: Summarize and Conclude\n\nSummary:\n- **From 3 ms to 5 ms**: Task A executes on the CPU.\n- **From 5 ms to 7 ms**: Task B executes on the CPU while Task A is doing I/O.\n- **At 7 ms**: Task A resumes and completes its remaining CPU execution (from 7 ms to 9 ms).\n- **From 7 ms to 9 ms**: Task C starts executing but is interrupted for I/O after 2 ms.\n- **At 9 ms**: Task B completes its remaining 1 ms of CPU time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option c because:\n- **Task A** runs from **3 to 5 ms (CPU)** and **7 to 9 ms (CPU)**.\n- **Task B** runs from **5 to 7 ms (CPU)** and finishes from **9 to 10 ms**.\n- **Task C** runs from **7 to 9 ms** and is **then interrupted for I/O**."

The query must be structured to join the employee table with itself to compare employees and their managers.\n2. **Self-Join (Employees a, Employees b)**:\n    - We are joining the `Employees` table with itself (aliasing as `a` and `b`).\n    - In this case:\n        - `a` represents the **employees** (whose salaries we are averaging).\n        - `b` represents the **managers** of those employees.\n3. **Columns E and F**:\n    - We need to retrieve the **Manager_ID** for each manager and the average salary of their employees.\n4. **Correct Mapping of E and F**:\n    - **E** is the **Manager_ID** (from table `b`, because `b` represents the managers).\n    - **F** is the **Emp_ID** (from table `a`, because `a` represents the employees who report to the managers).\n    - This is based on the `WHERE` condition, which checks if `a.Manager_ID = b.Emp_ID`. This condition matches each employee (`a`) with their manager (`b`).\n5. **Grouping and Ordering**:\n    - We group by the **Manager_ID** (`b.Emp_ID`), as we want to calculate the average salary of the employees for each manager.\n    - We also order the results by **Manager_ID** (`b.Emp_ID`) to display the managers in order.\n\n### Why option d is correct?:\n\n- **E** should be `b.Emp_ID`, which represents the **Manager_ID** in the final output (because `b` is the manager).\n- **F** should be `a.Manager_ID`, which represents the manager's ID in relation to the employee (because `a` is the employee)."

Also, MHS is designed for a different set of protocols compared to SMTP.\n\n**d) SMTP** - **(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is a protocol used for sending and receiving email messages across the internet. It handles the transmission of emails but does not concern itself with the format or content types of the messages being sent. While SMTP lacks the complexity of MHS, it is faster, more efficient, and well-suited for the broader, less formal nature of internet communication."

The **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** is a semi-trusted network that is accessible from the **external network**, and the **internal segment** is the most secure part of the network, designed to protect sensitive data from external threats. The **external network** is available to anyone, making it less secure and more likely to face attacks.\n\nThe **web server** is intended for users to access services, so placing it in the **DMZ** would allow it to be reachable from the external network while maintaining a level of security. The DMZ allows the web server to interact with users and restricts direct access to the internal network.\n\nMeanwhile, the **database**, which contains important and sensitive data, should be placed in the **internal segment**, the most secure part of the network.

Control charts help identify any trends or deviations from the norm.\n\n### Other Options:\n\n**a) Brainstorming** – This is a technique used for generating ideas or solutions, not for monitoring process stability.\n\n**b) Cause-and-effect diagram** – Also known as a fishbone diagram, it is used to identify potential causes of problems but does not track process stability over time.\n\n**d) Run chart** – A run chart also plots data over time, but it doesn't have control limits like a control chart, making it less useful for determining process stability."

        "solution": "### Explanation:\n\nIn **IT service management**, **incident management** focuses on restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible after a disruption. One of the key activities is receiving failure reports (incidents) from users and determining if they correspond to a **known error** that already has a documented workaround or solution. This is a crucial part of the incident management process to minimize the impact on service.\n\n### Other Options:\n\n**a) Evaluating customer satisfaction and performing reviews** – This is part of **service level management**, which focuses on ensuring service performance aligns with agreed targets, not incident management.\n\n**b) Examining free disk space** – This is part of **capacity management** or **monitoring**, not incident and service request management.\n\n**c) Investigating the impact of changes** – This falls under **change management**, which deals with assessing the impact of changes to the IT environment, not incidents or service requests."
