    "solution": "### Step 1: Understanding the Bubble Sort Algorithm\n\nWhen the array is sorted in reverse order, every adjacent pair of elements is out of order. This means that every comparison will result in a swap.\n\n- In the first pass through the array, bubble sort will compare the first element with the second, the second with the third, and so on, until the last element. This results in `N−1` comparisons and swaps.\n- In the second pass, the largest element (which is now at the end of the array) will not be compared. Thus, there will be `N−2` comparisons and swaps.\n- This pattern continues, leading to:\n    - First pass: `N−1` swaps\n    - Second pass: `N−2` swaps\n    - Third pass: `N−3` swaps\n    - ...\n    - Last pass: `1` swap\n\nGiven this, you can compute the total number of swaps using the formula:\n\n`Total Swaps = (N−1) + (N−2) + (N−3) + … + 1`\n\nor through:\n\n`N(N-1) ÷ 2`."

You cannot group by a calculated aggregate like **AverageScore**. SQL requires grouping by fields that are not aggregate functions (such as **Class** and **Subject**).\n\n**b) GROUP BY Class, Subject ORDER BY Class, AVG(Score)**:\n- Although the grouping part is correct, the **ORDER BY AVG(Score)** is problematic. You cannot order by an aggregate function in this context, since the prompt asks for ordering by **Class** and **Subject** (not by the average score). Ordering by **Class** and **Subject** is more logical when sorting the data.\n\n**d) GROUP BY Class, Subject, StudentNumber ORDER BY Class, Subject, AverageScore**:\n- This is incorrect because adding **StudentNumber** in the **GROUP BY** clause would break the purpose of averaging scores by **Class** and **Subject**. By grouping by **StudentNumber**, you would create a group for each student, effectively preventing the `AVG(Score)` from being calculated per **Class** and **Subject**.\n- Additionally, the **ORDER BY AverageScore** is not what the prompt asks for—it requires ordering by **Class** and **Subject**."

    "solution": "A **deadlock** occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, and none of them can proceed. To resolve a deadlock, the system must break the cycle of waiting by aborting one or more transactions involved in the deadlock.\n\n- **Rollback** refers to aborting a transaction and undoing any changes it has made.

Thus, **commit** cannot resolve a deadlock.\n\n**b) Drop**:\n- **Drop** is a command that removes a database object (like a table, index, or view) entirely. It is unrelated to resolving a deadlock situation in transactions. Dropping an object won’t free up resources involved in the deadlock, so this option is incorrect.\n\n**d) Roll Forward**:\n- **Roll Forward** is typically used during recovery after a failure, where committed transactions are applied to the database to bring it to a consistent state. This does not resolve a deadlock because it is related to restoring the database state after a crash, not resolving transactional conflicts."

    "question": "Which of the following is the network device that makes a forwarding decision on the basis of the destination MAC address in the frame header?",
    "options": [
      "Patch cable",
      "Repeater hub",
      "Router",
      "Switching hub"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "solution": "A **switching hub** (commonly referred to as a **switch**) is a network device that operates at the **data link layer** (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It makes forwarding decisions based on the **destination MAC address** contained in the frame header. When a frame arrives at the switch, the switch examines the MAC address of the destination device and forwards the frame only to the specific port associated with that address, reducing network congestion and improving performance.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**a) Patch cable**:\n- A **patch cable** is simply a physical medium, typically a twisted pair or fiber optic cable, used to connect devices to a switch, hub, router, or other network components. It does not make any forwarding decisions or interact with MAC addresses. Thus, this is not a network device.\n\n**b) Repeater hub**:\n- A **repeater hub** operates at the **physical layer** (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It does not examine or use MAC addresses. Instead, it broadcasts incoming data to all ports without distinguishing between devices, which results in higher network traffic and collisions. Since it does not make forwarding decisions based on the MAC address, this option is incorrect.\n\n**c) Router**:\n- A **router** operates at the **network layer** (Layer 3) of the OSI model and makes forwarding decisions based on **IP addresses**, not MAC addresses. It routes packets between different networks by examining the destination IP address. While routers play a key role in networking, they do not make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, so this option is incorrect."

      "192.168.11.255"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "solution": "The IP address **192.168.10.0/23** uses a **/23** subnet mask, which means the subnet mask is **255.255.254.0**. This gives the network a range that spans **2 consecutive Class C subnets** (a total of 512 IP addresses). A /23 subnet has **9 host bits**, which allows for 512 IP addresses (2^9 = 512), including network and broadcast addresses.\n\nCalculating the range:\n\n- **192.168.10.0/23** starts at **192.168.10.0** (the network address).\n- The last address in this range is the **broadcast address**. Since a /23 subnet spans 512 addresses, the network range includes addresses from **192.168.10.0** to **192.168.11.255**.\n\n Breakdown of the addresses:\n\n- The **network address** (first address in the range) is **192.168.10.0**.\n- The **last usable address** (the broadcast address) in this range is **192.168.11.255**, which is used to broadcast to all hosts within the network.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n- **a) 192.168.10.0**: This is the **network address**, not the broadcast address. It identifies the network itself and cannot be used as a broadcast address.\n- **b) 192.168.10.255**: This would be the broadcast address for a **/24** subnet (with subnet mask 255.255.255.0), but since we are dealing with a **/23** subnet, the broadcast address covers both 192.168.10.x and 192.168.11.x, making **192.168.11.255** the broadcast address.\n- **c) 192.168.10.511**: This is not a valid address because the maximum possible address in this range would be **192.168.11.255**."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "solution": "**LTE (Long Term Evolution)** is a communication standard used in mobile phone networks that meets all three of the characteristics described:\n\n1. **Packet switching scheme**: LTE uses packet-switched communication for data transfer, which is different from older circuit-switched networks used for voice calls. This allows for more efficient use of network resources, especially for data transmission.\n\n2. **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)**: LTE supports **MIMO**, a technology that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. MIMO enhances data throughput and signal reliability, which is a key feature in LTE networks.\n\n3. **Standardized by 3GPP**: LTE has been standardized by the **3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)**, which is a global collaboration between telecommunications organizations that work on mobile telecommunication standards like LTE and 5G.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**b) MAC (Media Access Control)**:\n- **Media Access Control (MAC)** is a protocol used to control how devices access and transmit data over a network, typically in wired or wireless LANs. It is not specific to mobile networks and does not meet the criteria of being a mobile communication standard that supports MIMO or packet switching in mobile networks.\n\n**c) MDM (Mobile Device Management)**:\n- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** refers to software solutions used by organizations to manage and secure mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. It has nothing to do with mobile network communication standards and does not involve packet switching or MIMO technology.\n\n**d) VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**:\n- **VoIP** is a technology used to deliver voice communications over IP networks (like the internet), but it is not a mobile network communication standard. While VoIP uses packet switching for voice data, it is not standardized by 3GPP, nor does it typically support MIMO technology."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "solution": "RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptography algorithm that relies on the mathematical challenge of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. The security of RSA is based on the fact that while multiplying two large prime numbers is computationally simple, factoring their product back into the original primes is extremely difficult, especially when the numbers are very large. This is known as the integer factorization problem, and it is the foundation of RSA's encryption and key exchange mechanisms.\n\n### Why the Others Won't Fit\n\n**a) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**:\n\n- AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. AES relies on complex mathematical transformations for security, but it does not depend on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.\n\n**b) DH (Diffie-Hellman)**:\n\n- Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel.

So you'll need to budget your finds wisely.\nCPI helps track how much this thing costs, or that thing costs and increases the overall chance for a project to be completed within budget.\n\n**Formula for Earned Value = Percent of Work Complete x Project Budget**\n**Formula for CPI = Earned Value / Actual Cost**\n\n**Earned Value** is basically how much work you've done based on the total project duration.\n\nSo far, 1 month has passed by and the duration of the project is 4 months, so we're 25% complete.\nPut that in the **Earned Value** formula and we'll get 25,000.\n\nNow we can get the CPI, so input those numbers in the formula and we'll get 1.25."

These include processes, checklists, etc.\n\n1) First, by just using common sense you need strategy first (the overall plan) before doing anything, so with that you've eliminated half of the options.\n2) Next, you'll need design.\n3) Next is transition. This is moving new services into a live environment. Basically going from development to production.\n4) Next is operation. This is more like `maintenance` from the other management strategies. This is where you'll maintain, handle errors, and overall manage.\n5) Lastly, you have the Continual Service Improvement. This is where you'll identify areas of improvement and how you can optimize your servers and costs."
