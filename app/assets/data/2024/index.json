    "solution": "### Step 1: Convert the whole part (123) to decimal.\n\nThe hexadecimal number `123` can be expanded as:\n\n$1 \\times 16^2 + 2 \\times 16^1 + 3 \\times 16^0$\n\n$= 1 \\times 256 + 2 \\times 16 + 3 \\times 1$\n\n$= 256 + 32 + 3 = 291$\n\n ### Step 2: Convert the fractional part (0.4) to decimal.\n\nIn hexadecimal, `4` means \\( 4 \\times 16^{-1} \\):\n\n$4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = 0.25$\n\n ### Step 3: Add the whole and fractional parts together.\n\n$291 + 0.25 = 291.25$"

    "solution": "### Step 1: List down the given\n\nGiven:\n- 5 people\n- 2 coffee orders\n- 3 tea orders\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability\n\nTo calculate probability, you must divide the number of favorable events by the total number of possible events.\n\n*Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes*\n\nUsing the formula above, it would be possible to calculate for the final answer using the values for either tea or coffee being served to the correct people. Since in the case that either one of them is served correctly, then the other will also be the same.\n\nCalculating for P, probability, using the values for coffee:\n\n$P = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{20} = 0.1$\n\nUsing the values for tea:\n\n$P = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6}{60} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$"

    "solution": "### Step 1: Understanding Postfix Notation\n\nIn postfix notation, the operator appears after the operands, i.e., the operator between operands is taken out & is attached after operands.\n\n**Example:** Translate a ∗ d − (b + c) into Postfix form.\n\nad ∗ bc + −\n\nSince operators appear after operands ad * becomes translated into a * d and bc + becomes translated into b + c.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "solution": "### Step 1: Understanding the Bubble Sort Algorithm\n\nWhen the array is sorted in reverse order, every adjacent pair of elements is out of order. This means that every comparison will result in a swap.\n\n- In the first pass through the array, bubble sort will compare the first element with the second, the second with the third, and so on, until the last element. This results in N−1 comparisons and swaps.\n- In the second pass, the largest element (which is now at the end of the array) will not be compared. Thus, there will be N−2 comparisons and swaps.\n- This pattern continues, leading to:\n    - First pass: N−1 swaps\n    - Second pass: N−2 swaps\n    - Third pass: N−3 swaps\n    - ...\n    - Last pass: 1 swap\n\nGiven this, you can calculate the total number of swaps through this formula:\n\n$Total Swaps=(N−1)+(N−2)+(N−3)+…+1$\n\nor through\n\n$\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$"
